Disclaimer: I passionately hate JPA and Hibernate.My relationship with Hibernate (JPA hasn’t yet existed back then) has been rocky from the very beginning. Somewhere as far back as 2005 or 2007, an interviewer asked me how I’d go about mapping the 1-N relationship with Hibernate. ”I have no idea what Hibernate is,” I said.
Then in 2008 I got a job at Softage to work on a project based on Swing and Hibernate.</description></item><item><title>Portfolio</title><link>https://azhidkov.pro/en/portfolio/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Mar 2021 13:25:37 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://azhidkov.pro/en/portfolio/</guid><description>Aleksey ZhidkovArchitect, Tech Lead https://azhidkov.pro https://github.com/d-r-q
I specialize in developing information systems ([1],[2],[3]) powered by the Java platform. However, I’m quite versatile thanks to having nineteen years of experience, loving what I do, and reading English fluently. That’s why my background also includes working on Python desktop apps, low-level video capture software with C, and Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile apps.
I’ve been working as a software engineer since 2005, and as an independent consultant since 2017.</description></item></channel></rss>
