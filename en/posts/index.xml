Disclaimer: I passionately hate JPA and Hibernate.My relationship with Hibernate (JPA hasn’t yet existed back then) has been rocky from the very beginning. Somewhere as far back as 2005 or 2007, an interviewer asked me how I’d go about mapping the 1-N relationship with Hibernate. ”I have no idea what Hibernate is,” I said.
Then in 2008 I got a job at Softage to work on a project based on Swing and Hibernate.</description></item></channel></rss>
